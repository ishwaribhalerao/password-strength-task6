## 🧪 Password Testing and Evaluation

| Password         | Length | Strength Level | Time to Crack   | Tool Feedback |
|------------------|--------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| `P@ssw0rd123`     | 11     | Very Weak      | 0 seconds         | Common pattern; too predictable. Like leaving your front door wide open. |
| `charu1421`       | 9      | Medium         | 8 days            | Common word + digits; lacks complexity. |
| `Charu$1421`      | 10     | Strong         | 2 months          | Decent strength; uses symbols and mixed case. |
| `H3llo!#Ch@ru`    | 12     | Strong         | 1 year            | Strong due to length and variety; good complexity. |
| `Qysib#1hf%`      | 10     | Very Strong    | 8 thousand years  | Excellent randomness; very secure. |

## 🔍 Observations

- **Very Weak Passwords**: `P@ssw0rd123` is highly predictable even with symbols. It uses a well-known base word and number sequence, making it easy for attackers.
- **Medium Passwords**: `charu1421` includes a name and numbers, offering some complexity but still vulnerable due to predictability.
- **Strong Passwords**: `Charu$1421` and `H3llo!#Ch@ru` use special characters, upper/lower case, and numbers — significantly increasing their strength.
- **Very Strong Passwords**: `Qysib#1hf%` is random, hard to guess, and includes all character types — ideal for secure logins.

## ✅ Tips for Creating Strong Passwords

- Use at least **12 characters**.
- Mix **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**.
- Avoid dictionary words, names, or common patterns (e.g., `password123`).
- Use **random combinations** or **passphrases**.
- Never reuse the same password across different accounts.
- Consider using a **password manager** for generating and storing passwords.

## 🧠 Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type         | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Brute-force Attack**     | Tries all possible combinations until the correct one is found. Longer, complex passwords reduce this risk. |
| **Dictionary Attack**      | Tries words from a list of common passwords or dictionary entries. Avoid using real words or names. |
| **Credential Stuffing**    | Uses passwords from previous breaches on other sites. Always use **unique passwords**. |
| **Phishing**               | Tricking users into revealing their password. Complexity doesn’t help here; awareness and unique credentials do. |

## 🧾 Summary

Password strength directly affects your digital security. Strong passwords:
- Take **years to crack**.
- Protect against **automated attacks**.
- Are harder to guess or brute-force.

**Avoid shortcuts** like swapping letters with symbols (`P@ssw0rd`) — attackers already know those tricks.

> Strong passwords are **random**, **long**, and **unique**. Invest in a password manager to handle them safely and effortlessly.
